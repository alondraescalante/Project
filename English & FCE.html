		<div class="subtitulo"> Equity and Equality </div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Equity is when a person or thing have specific opportunities according to its condition. For example, in a soccer game to see what’s happening and there are some levels to stand up there, a tall person won’t need that, but a person that is not very tall will need at least one of these levels. </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Instead, equality is when all the people is exactly the same without taking about its condition, all the people have the same opportunities. For example, in the case of the soccer game, all the people will have a level, no matter if it is tall or short. </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Nowadays, both of these situations we can find them in social media, in the news, in our jobs, etc.… Now the most important or notable case is the gender inequality, where the women can´t participate in some politic positions or can’t receive education “because they are women”. </p></div>
		<div class="subtitulo"><p> Ability, Capacity and Potentiality </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> And now we are going to talk about this three points. At the beginning we can think that they are the same, but no, they have something different. </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Potentiality is the possibility of someone doing something in the future. In other words, is when we know we can do some thing but we haven’t tried yet. </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Capacity refers to the ability or power to do, experience or understand something. Is when we can do an activity but we are not experts in that yet. </p></div>
		<div class="parrafo"><p> Ability, a skill that a person has in a determined activity, when we are already experts in that activity, we have talent, skill or professionalism in that particular area. </p></div>
